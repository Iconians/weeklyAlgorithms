// Balanced Parentheses:
// Write a function that takes a string of parentheses and determines if they are balanced. For example, "{[()]}" is balanced, but "{[(])}" is not.
// Hint: Use a stack to push opening brackets and pop them when closing brackets are encountered.

// Reverse a Stack:
// Implement a function that reverses the contents of a stack without using any additional data structures like arrays or lists.
// Hint: Use recursion to reverse the stack.

// Evaluate Postfix Expression:
// Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression. The expression will consist of operands and operators, e.g., 3 4 + 2 * should output 14.
// Hint: Use a stack to hold operands and evaluate when operators are encountered.

// Sort a Stack:
// Implement a function to sort a stack in ascending order without using any additional data structures. You can only use one additional stack to help.
// Hint: Use recursion to insert elements into the sorted stack.

// Largest Rectangle in Histogram:
// Given an array of heights representing a histogram where the width of each bar is 1, write a function to find the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram.
// Hint: Use a stack to efficiently calculate the largest rectangle.
